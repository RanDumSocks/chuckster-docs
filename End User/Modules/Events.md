# Events module
This was the main module for the creation of Chuckster. This makes setting and joining events easy for people in all parts of the world, as it takes timezones into account.

## Quick Start
In order to use this module to the fullest, you first must set your timezone. use the `/events setzone` command to do this. Using this command on its own will prompt you to go to a specific website and copy/paste the timezone string into the command as the optional parameter.

Once that is correctly set, you can now create an event with `/events create` which will ask for time and title information for the event you want to create.
