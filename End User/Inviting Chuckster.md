# Server Setup

Chuckster requires administration permissions for everything to work correctly. The following link should take you directly to the authentication page to invite Chuckster to your server. You must have server management privilages on said server to invite any bot to it.

[Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=794375965336928267&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Once you've invited Chuckster to your server, he is pretty useless because all functionality is turned off by default. As a server owner or administrator, you must enable individual modules. See [[Modules#Enabling Modules]] for more info.

## Hosting

The bot is hosted on my own server, which restarts daily at [5am America/Los_Angeles](https://www.zeitverschiebung.net/en/timezone/america--los_angeles). There currently isn't any way to self host, in the future source code will be avaliable easily, but if you are reallyy curious I will be glad to hand over a working copy of the source manually.
