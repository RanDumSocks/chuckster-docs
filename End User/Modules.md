# Modules
Chuckster consists of modules, which can be enabled/disabled per server. Using the `/help` command, you can see the names of all modules, and whether they are enabled, disabled, or premium only. Premium modules are a work in progress and may be locked behind a paywall in the future.

The help command should look similar to this:

- [[Plan]] - Find common time ranges between people for event planning. Works with timezones and find the longest shared time range between all users.
- [[Poll]] - Create fully customisable polls which other people can vote on.

- [[Twitter Game]] - Fun game where you and your friends try to guess who sent to displayed tweet.

## Enabling Modules
To enable a module on your server, and administrator must use the `/enablemodule` command. When selected, you will see a list of modules you are allowed to enable. Select one and send the command to instantly enable the module in your server.

## Disabling Modules
This is the same as [enabling modules](Modules.md#Enabling%20Modules), just with the `/disablemodule` command.
